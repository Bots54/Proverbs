Isikhova sidla ngeso laso, esimehl' ankungu sifa yindlala- An owl eats its eye,the one with misty eyes dies of hunger.
Ithemba alibulali,kubulala ubungxamo- Hope never kills,but rushing things does
Isiqhelo siyayoyisa ingqondo- Habit defeats the mind
Ukukhula kukubona- Growing is seeing
Inkomo isengwa ngoyaziyo- A cow is milked by the one who knows it
Ulunya lubuz' olunye- One act of evil begets another
Neqaqa liyagquma kowalo umngxuma- Even a skunk roars in its hole
Amadoda akafani,afana ngeentshebe kuphela- Men are not the same,they are only the same by their beards
